# Lonus dark theme

Here is the VS Code theme that I use. I like dark themes with some color to it so heres mine.

I took inspiration on the color palette from an **Atom** theme called [Vertex](https://github.com/xypnox/vertex-ui) since theres no VS CODE port I decided to add the colors myself using [Theme Studio for VS Code ](https://themes.vscode.one/) to edit it easly.
