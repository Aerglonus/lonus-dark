### Lonus dark theme

Here is the VS Code theme that I use. I like dark themes with some color to it so heres mine.

I took inspiration on the color palette from an **Atom ** theme called [Vertex](https://github.com/xypnox/vertex-ui) since theres no VS CODE port I decided to add the colors myself using [Theme Studio for VS Code ](https://themes.vscode.one/) to edit it easly.

## Installation

1 - Open the **Extensions** sidebar panel from within the Visual Studio Code editor window.  

`Menu Path : View > Extensions`  

`Keyboard Shortcut : Ctrl + Shift + X`

2 - Search for the theme in the extension marketplace search and then click the **Install** button.  

**`Search Term : lonus-dark`**

3 - Enable the installed theme from the Color Theme drop down list.  

`Menu Path : Code / File > Preferences > Color Theme > Theme +`

4 - To have more distinguishable brackets, make sure you have VS Code native bracket colorization enabled by adding this to your JSON settings file:

```json

```
